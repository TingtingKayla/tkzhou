# Biography

I obtained my PhD in [Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) from the [University of Michigan](umich.edu) on August 29, 2018. My PhD advisors are [Prof. Roderick Little] (https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/rod-little/) and [Prof. Michael Elliott] (https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/people/michael-elliott/). My research is mainly in the area of causal inference and missing data. For my dissertation, I developed a new robust method for estimating treatment effects from observational studies, called PENCOMP, and addressed two closely related topics on causal inference: limited overlap and variable selection in causal inference. I also worked as a research assistant at the [Center for Statistical Genetics](https://sph.umich.edu/csg/) and a statistical consultant for the Department of Neurology, University of Michigan School of Medicine.

Here's my [CV](/cv/tingting_cv.pdf).
