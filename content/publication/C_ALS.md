abstract = "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has an immune component, but previous human studies have not examined immune changes over time. To assess peripheral inflammatory markers in participants with ALS and healthy control individuals and to track immune changes in ALS and determine whether these changes correlate with disease progression, a longitudinal cohort study was analyzed. In the study, leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood samples from 35 controls and 119 participants with ALS at the ALS Clinic of the University of Michigan. Follow-up visits occurred every 6 to 12 months. Fifty-one participants with ALS provided samples at multiple points. Immune cell populations were measured and compared between control and ALS groups. Surface marker expression of CD11b+ myeloid cells was also assessed. Changes over time were correlated with disease progression using multivariate regression."
