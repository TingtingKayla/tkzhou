abstract = "Propensity score (PS) methods are popular for controlling for observed confounders in causal inference about treatment comparisons. However, for PS methods to work well, there should have a sufficient overlap in the propensity distribution between treatment groups. This suggests (a) defining alternative estimands that restrict inferences to subpopulations where all treatments have the potential to be assigned, and (b) excluding sample cases where the propensity to receive one of the compared treatments is close to zero. In this paper, we address investigate appropriate restrictions of the causal estimand and compare alternative estimation methods, including simple and augmented weighted estimators and PENCOMP, a robust multiple-imputation based approach that we proposed recently. We apply these methods to estimate the effects of antiretroviral treatment on CD4 counts in HIV+ patients."
