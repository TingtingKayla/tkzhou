abstract = "Radiation necrosis is a major complication of radiation therapy. We explore the features of radiation-induced brain necrosis in the rat, using multiple MRI approaches, including T1, T2, apparent diffusion constant (ADC), cerebral blood flow (CBF), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and amide proton transfer (APT) of endogenous mobile proteins and peptides. Adult rats (Fischer 344; n = 15) were irradiated with a single, well-collimated X-ray beam (40 Gy; 10 × 10 mm2) in the left brain hemisphere. MRI was acquired on a 4.7 T animal scanner at ~25 weeks post-radiation. The MRI signals of necrotic cores and peri-necrotic regions were assessed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Histological evaluation was accomplished with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining."
